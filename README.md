# Community Toolshed

This is the 4th milestone project for the CodeInstitute level 5 Web Application Development Course

The Community Toolshed Renting Application is a platform that allows users to subscribe and rent tools and party items on a daily basis. Subscribers pay an annual fee to gain access to a shared inventory of tools and reusable party supplies, promoting sustainability, affordability, and community resource sharing.

This project is potentially something that will be reworked into a live project used by the Handcross Hardware local store, where I currently help at.

## Project Goals

### üîπ User & Subscription Management
Users can create an account and subscribe to access rentals.
Subscription is yearly ($10/year) and grants full access to item rentals.

### üîπ Item Rentals (Tools & Party Items)
Tools: Individually tracked items with serial numbers, repair status, and availability.
Party Items: Bulk-tracked items (plates, cups, cutlery) with stock and damage tracking.
First-come, first-serve rental system.

### üîπ Order & Rental Management
Users place rental orders for specific date ranges.
Orders track damaged items and cleaning requirements for reusable items.
Rentals must be returned before new orders are placed.

### üîπ Payments & Transactions
Secure payment processing for subscriptions and rentals.
Payment statuses: pending, paid, failed.

### üîπ Maintenance & Repairs
Tools marked as broken or needing repair are sent for maintenance.
Maintenance requests track repair status (pending, in_progress, fixed, written_off).

## üéØ Business Objectives

This website should advertise the benefits of joining the Community Toolshed and subscribing to the rental service. The main goal is to attract new subscribers and encourage existing subscribers to continue their membership.

The business wants to be able to verify the identity of users and ensure that they are responsible renters. The business also wants to track the condition of items and ensure that they are maintained and repaired as needed.

There will be a 1 year subscription fee of ¬£10 for all users. This fee will be used to maintain the website and cover the cost of repairs and maintenance.

## Future Considerations

Due to time constraints, there are some features that were not implemented in this project that could be added in the future

- Add a feature to allow users to request items that are not currently in the inventory
- Flesh out the rating system to allow users to rate items and leave reviews
- use the stripe subscription feature to manage the subscription payments
