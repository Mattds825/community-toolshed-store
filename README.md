# Community Toolshed

[live site](https://ci-community-toolshed-afafcfe7f3c4.herokuapp.com/)

This is the 4th milestone project for the CodeInstitute level 5 Web Application Development Course

The Community Toolshed Renting Application is a platform that allows users to subscribe and rent tools and party items on a daily basis. Subscribers pay an annual fee to gain access to a shared inventory of tools and reusable party supplies, promoting sustainability, affordability, and community resource sharing.

This project is potentially something that will be reworked into a live project used by the Handcross Hardware local store, where I currently help at.

## In a Nutshell

Community Toolshed is a full-stack e-commerce platform built with Django, Stripe, and Bootstrap, designed for a local hardware store‚Äôs rental service. The platform allows users to sign up, subscribe, and rent tools or party items, such as cutlery, plates, and power tools. Once subscribed, users can place rental orders, view past orders, and manage their profiles. Payments are securely processed using Stripe, ensuring a smooth checkout experience. The platform also includes a dedicated management system where store managers can add, edit, and remove products, as well as oversee rentals. A built-in maintenance system enables managers to track tool conditions, create repair tickets, and update tool statuses as needed. The site features a responsive, user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless navigation across devices.

This project was built using Code Institute‚Äôs Boutique Ado template as a foundation. However, significant modifications were made to the Django models, templates, and order logic to better suit the rental-based functionality and management features required for the Community Toolshed service. The project follows best practices in version control using Git and GitHub and is deployed on Heroku for live access.

## Project Goals

### üîπ User & Subscription Management
Users can create an account and subscribe to access rentals.
Subscription is yearly ($10/year) and grants full access to item rentals.

### üîπ Item Rentals (Tools & Party Items)
Tools: Individually tracked items with serial numbers, repair status, and availability.
Party Items: Bulk-tracked items (plates, cups, cutlery) with stock and damage tracking.
First-come, first-serve rental system.

### üîπ Order & Rental Management
Users place rental orders for specific date ranges.
Orders track damaged items and cleaning requirements for reusable items.
Rentals must be returned before new orders are placed.

### üîπ Payments & Transactions
Secure payment processing for subscriptions and rentals.
Payment statuses: pending, paid, failed.

### üîπ Maintenance & Repairs
Tools marked as broken or needing repair are sent for maintenance.
Maintenance requests track repair status (pending, in_progress, fixed, written_off).

## üéØ Business Objectives

This website should advertise the benefits of joining the Community Toolshed and subscribing to the rental service. The main goal is to attract new subscribers and encourage existing subscribers to continue their membership.

The business wants to be able to verify the identity of users and ensure that they are responsible renters. The business also wants to track the condition of items and ensure that they are maintained and repaired as needed.

There will be a 1 year subscription fee of ¬£10 for all users. This fee will be used to maintain the website and cover the cost of repairs and maintenance.

### Database Design 

#### Item Model

![item model table](/documentation/erd/item_table.png)

- In the type field, the item is either a tool or a party item, 0 or 1 respectively
- In the current implementation the item can only have one category

#### Category Model

![category model table](/documentation/erd/category_table.png)

#### Tool Model

**Subclass of Item Model**

![tool model table](/documentation/erd/tool_table.png)

- The tool condition can be one fo the following
```python
TOOL_CONDITION = (
    (0, 'New'),
    (1, 'Fair'),
    (2, 'Poor'),
)
```
- The tool model has a serial number field to track individual tools. The item parent has and sku field which allows multiple tool of the same kind, and still be individually maintained

#### PartyItem Model

**Subclass of Item Model**

![party item model table](/documentation/erd/party_item_table.png)

- the party items are bulk tracked, so there is no serial number field, instead teh following fields are used to track the item
    - available_amount: the amount of items available for rent
    - broken_amount: the amount of items that are damaged
    - stock_amount: the amount of items in stock

#### Order Model

![order model table](/documentation/erd/order_table.png)

- The payment status can be one of the following
```python
PAYMENT_STATUS = (
    ('pending', 'Pending'),
    ('paid', 'Paid'),
    ('failed', 'Failed'),
)
```
- the stripe_pid field is used to store the stripe payment id
- start_date and end_date are used to track the rental period
- the order is associated with a UserProfile for the user who placed the order, this allows the user to view their order history

#### OrderItem Model

![order item model table](/documentation/erd/order_item_table.png)

- the order item has a status, which can be:
```python 
ORDER_ITEM_STATUS = (
    ('reserved', 'Reserved'),
    ('active', 'Currently Rented'),    
    ('returned', 'Returned'),    
)
```
- the order item is associated with an order, this allows the user to view the details of an individual order
- the order item is directly associated with an item, this allows the user to view the details of an individual item

#### Subscription Model

![subscription model table](/documentation/erd/subscription_table.png)

- the subscription is associated with a UserProfile, this allows the user to view their subscription status
    - users with an active subscription can rent items
    - users with an inactive subscription cannot rent items
- the is a stripe_pid field to store the stripe payment id
- the subscription number is unique to each subscription and users can purchase a new subscription each year

#### UserProfile Model

![user profile model table](/documentation/erd/user_profile_table.png)

This model is used to store the user's profile information and is associated with the Django User model

- there is a verified field to track if the user has been verified
- there is a subscription field to track if the user has an active subscription
    - in practice this would allows managers to verify users once they visit the store

#### MaintenanceTicket Model

![maintenance ticket model table](/documentation/erd/maintenance_ticket_table.png)

A maintenance ticket is created when a user/manager reports an item as needing maintenance

- the status field can be one of the following
```python
MAINTENANCE_STATUS = (
    ('pending', 'Pending'),    
    ('fixed', 'Fixed'),
    ('written_off', 'Written Off'),
)
```
- the maintenance ticket is associated with an tool, this allows the user/manager to view the details of the tool and also view care instructions
- the maintenance ticket can be associated with an order, this allows the user/manager to track down the details of the order and also view the rental period and who rented the item

#### EmailAddress and EmailConfirmation Models

These are additional models that are used to manage the email verification process

![email address model table](/documentation/erd/email_address_table.png)
![email confirmation model table](/documentation/erd/email_confirmation_table.png)

#### Compete ERD

This is the complete ERD for the project

It was generated with the graph_models command and the image was created with GraphvizOnline

## Testing

Testing information can be found in the [TESTING.md file](/TESTING.md)

## Future Considerations

Due to time constraints, there are some features that were not implemented in this project that could be added in the future

### Time Bound

- there is some redundancy in my tables that could be removed
- I managed to implement the maintenance system for tool, but did not have time to implement the cleaning system for the party items
- I waned to create dining sets with the part items but did not have time to implement this

### Future Features

- Add a feature to allow users to request items that are not currently in the inventory
- Flesh out the rating system to allow users to rate items and leave reviews
- use the built in stripe subscription feature to manage the subscription payments
