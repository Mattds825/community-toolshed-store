# Community Toolshed

This is the 4th milestone project for the CodeInstitute level 5 Web Application Development Course

The Community Toolshed Renting Application is a platform that allows users to subscribe and rent tools and party items on a daily basis. Subscribers pay an annual fee to gain access to a shared inventory of tools and reusable party supplies, promoting sustainability, affordability, and community resource sharing.

This project is potentially something that will be reworked into a live project used by the Handcross Hardware local store, where I currently help at.

## Project Goals

### üîπ User & Subscription Management
Users can create an account and subscribe to access rentals.
Subscription is yearly ($10/year) and grants full access to item rentals.

### üîπ Item Rentals (Tools & Party Items)
Tools: Individually tracked items with serial numbers, repair status, and availability.
Party Items: Bulk-tracked items (plates, cups, cutlery) with stock and damage tracking.
First-come, first-serve rental system.

### üîπ Order & Rental Management
Users place rental orders for specific date ranges.
Orders track damaged items and cleaning requirements for reusable items.
Rentals must be returned before new orders are placed.

### üîπ Payments & Transactions
Secure payment processing for subscriptions and rentals.
Payment statuses: pending, paid, failed.

### üîπ Maintenance & Repairs
Tools marked as broken or needing repair are sent for maintenance.
Maintenance requests track repair status (pending, in_progress, fixed, written_off).

## How to Use

### Stripe Card Test Numbers

You can use these card numbers at the checkout to test stripe payment integration

| CARD NUMBER |	SCENARIO | HOW TO TEST |
| --- | --- | ---|
| 4242424242424242 | The card payment succeeds and doesn‚Äôt require authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |
| 4000002500003155 | The card payment requires authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |
